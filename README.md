# Operating a Charm that uses this layer

Charms using this layer will automatically request and renew a Let's Encrypt certificate for the `fqdn` specified in the Charm config.

## Requirements

Let's Encrypt registration will only work in deployments that meet the
following criteria:

- Placement onto a machine with a public IPv4 address. IPv6 might work (Let's
  Encrypt supports it), but this is unconfirmed.
  - Container placement will not work. Containers aren't typically publicly
    route-able.
  - Private networks will not work. For private TLS, I recommend using
    layer:tls-client with easyrsa.
- Registered DNS "A" record for the above public address.
  - Must be a domain name allowed by Let's Encrypt. Some, such as
    *.amazonaws.com dynamic addresses, are not allowed.
- Must be exposed (`juju expose`) so that Let's Encrypt can reach it for
  registration.

## Configuration

This layer adds a config option `fqdn` to `config.yaml`. When set, this layer
will attempt to register the hostname with Let's Encrypt. Only set `fqdn`:
- _After_ the DNS "A" record has been established for the unit's public IP
  address.
- The registered domain name has had time to propagate.
- The application has been `juju expose`d.

A `contact-email` config option may also be set, for receiving email from Let's Encrypt regarding certification of the domain name. *Note that changing `contact-email` after the certificate has been requested will not have any effect.*

# Developing a Charm with this layer

## Single FQDN

Follow these steps if you need a single certificate for a single domain name. This is the legacy way of using the lets-encrypt layer where an admin specifies the fqdn using a config option.

Include `layer:lets-encrypt` in your web application charm and set the `fqdn` config option to automatically obtain a TLS certificate from Let's Encrypt.

Once the application is registered with Let's Encrypt, the reactive state
`lets-encrypt.registered` will be set. Then, in your charm, you may obtain the
path to the certificates and keys with `charms.layer.lets_encrypt.live()`. This will return a dictionary with the following keys:

 - **`privkey`**: Private key for the certificate. *`SSLCertificateKeyFile` in Apache and `ssl_certificate_key` in NGINX.*
 - **`fullchain`**: All certificates, including server certificate (aka leaf certificate or end-entity certificate). The server certificate is the first one in this file, followed by any intermediates. *`SSLCertificateFile` in Apache and `ssl_certificate` in NGINX.*
 - **`dhparam`**: Secure Diffie Hellman parameters as defined by [ietf RFC3526](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3526#page-5) *`SSLOpenSSLConfCmd DHParameters` in Apache and `ssl_dhparam` in NGINX.*
 - `cert`: The server certificate.
 - `chain`: The additional intermediate certificates that web browsers will need in order to validate the server certificate.

### Example: Using with layer:nginx

Configure layer:lets-encrypt to restart nginx during registration:

```yaml
options:
  lets-encrypt:
    service-name: nginx
```

Use the obtained certificates in your charm layer. For example:

```python
from charmhelpers.core import hookenv
from charms.layer import lets_encrypt

...

@when('nginx.available', 'lets-encrypt.registered')
@when_not('myapp.web.configured')
def configure_webserver():
    status_set('maintenance', 'Configuring website')
	fqdn = config().get('fqdn')
    live = lets_encrypt.live()
    configure_site('myapp', 'myapp.nginx.tmpl',
                   key_path=live['privkey'],
                   crt_path=live['fullchain'], fqdn=fqdn)
    host.service_restart('nginx')
    status_set('active', 'Website available: https://%s' % fqdn)
```

You'll want to use the `fqdn` for `server_name` in your nginx site config.

Let's Encrypt registration may be disabled by setting the
`lets-encrypt.disable` state. If you know your charm isn't ready to register,
or doesn't need it -- maybe it's being TLS terminated by a front end -- please
set this to avoid wasting Let's Encrypt resources.

Certificate renewal may be disabled by setting the `lets-encrypt.renew.disable`
state. Set this to prevent the `lets-encrypt` layer from temporarily stopping
the configured `service-name` during certificate renewal.


## Multiple FQDNs

Follow these steps if you need multiple certificates for multiple domain names. The FQDNs need to be set by a higher layer. You can use both methods (single and multiple fqdns) at the same time. If both the config option is set and `set_requested_certificates` is called, then a certificate will be generated for all fqdns.

Include `layer:lets-encrypt` in your charm and use `charms.layer.lets_encrypt.set_requested_certificates(requests)` to create multiple certificates. `requests` has the following format:
```
[
    {
        'fqdn': ['example.com', 'blog.example.com'], # Covers multiple domains with one certificate
        'contact_email': ''
    },
    {
        'fqdn': ['sample.com'],
        'contact-email': 'foo@sample.com'
    },
    ...
]
```
Obtain the path to the certificates with `charms.layer.lets_encrypt.live_all()`. This will return a dictionary with the fqdn's as keys and a dictionary with the same keys as described above from `live()`. In case of multiple domains certificate only one fqdn will be present.

Following the example above, `live_all()` could return the following output:
```
{
    'example.com': {
                       'privkey': '',
                       'fullchain': '',
                       'cert': '',
                       'chain': '',
                       'dhparam': '',
                   }
     'sample.com': {
                       'privkey': '',
                       'fullchain': '',
                       'cert': '',
                       'chain': '',
                       'dhparam': '',
                   }
}
```
 
# Caveats

The configured `service-name` will be temporarily stopped while Let's Encrypt
registers and renews with the "standalone" method.

This layer is only supported on xenial and above. If deployed on earlier series, this
layer does nothing.

This layer requires agreement to the ISRG Let's Encrypt terms of service in
order to deploy, because registration is done non-interactively in the charm.

# TODOs

Some things could be improved:

- Better rate-limiting of the registration retries.
- Not attempting to register if not exposed (can this be detected?).
- Not attempting to register if FQDN isn't ready, or is incorrect.
- Non-interrupting methods like webroot.
